# DBMS-2022

This repository contains all the Labs and Project related work done by our team during the Database Systems(for CSE) / Data Engineering (for AI) course. 
We have used mysql databases using C++. 

## Steps to Run code for a Submission Folder

- Checkout the username, password, database name being used in the .cpp MySQL scripts. 
- Make a user having the same credentials as above, and then a database of the same name as above.
- FInally run the .cpp files in the order as mentioned in the report.pdf

## Running the code files
Inorder to run the code for any particular lab submission, open that particular folder, you can open the .cpp files, and find the command to run that particular file in the 1st line of the file. 

Also do make sure to check out the order in which the files need to be run, in the report.pdf file of each lab/project folder.
